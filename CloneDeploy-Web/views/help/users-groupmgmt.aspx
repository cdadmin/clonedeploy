    <h1>Users->Group Based Computer Management</h1>
    <p>
        If you want to limit a user to only have control over specific groups and computers this is where you do it.
        By default the ACLs for groups and computers apply to all groups and computers. This setting would disable the global
        permission and assign those permissions only to the selected groups and group members.
